<EMB>NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS</EMB>

<EMB>California Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits
courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not
certified for publication or ordered published, except as
specified by rule 8.1115(b). This opinion has not been certified
for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule & blk14;
8.1115.</EMU> 

<CN><EMB>REDACTED OPINION
FOR PUBLIC VIEW</EMU><fnr*>.

<P20>Defendant and appellant Russel Nathan Szerlip was convicted
in July 2016 of four counts of committing lewd acts upon two
of his minor daughters and one count of continuous sexual
abuse. In August 2023, defendant was sentenced to 75 years
to life in prison.

<P20>Defendant raises five contentions of error on appeal. First,
he maintains that the trial court erred by admitting evidence
he molested one of several young daughters as propensity evidence
under Evidence Code section 1108, through hearsay testimony
by other witnesses, through section 1360. Second, defendant
contends that the trial court erred by not declaring a doubt
as to his mental competency. Third, defendant asserts he received
ineffective assistance of counsel. Fourth, defendant argues
the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion
for new trial. Fifth and finally, defendant insists the trial
court erred in denying his request to be represented by retained
counsel of choice, a request made over seven years after his
conviction. Finding no merit in any of defendant's assertions
of error, we affirm.

<CN><EMB>BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>I. Witnesses, Victims, and Family Relationships</EMB>

<P20>This case involves a large number of witnesses, victims and
intertwined familial relationships. To minimize confusion,
we begin with a brief recitation of the victims and principal
witnesses, and the nature of their relationship to defendant,
other witnesses or the case.

<P20>Melissa V.,<fnr1> the named victim in three
counts, is daughter of defendant and his first wife, Yolanda
N. Melissa, born in March 1993, was as young as three or four
years old when she was first sexually abused by defendant,
and age 23 at the time of trial. Anabell J.<fnr2>
is Melissa's half sister.

<P20>Angelica N., Melissa's half sister, is the daughter of defendant
and his second wife, Maribel N. Angelica was three years old
when she was first molested, five years old when she last
saw defendant, and 16 at the time of trial. For a few months
when Maribel lost custody of Angelica, Mr. G. and his wife
were foster parents for the three-year-old.

<P20>S.S., the victim in one count of sexual abuse, is another
of Melissa's half sisters. S.S. is the daughter of defendant
and his third wife, E.C. S.S., who was five years old when
she testified at trial, has three siblings, Ashley S., Roxanne
S. and Matthew S. Renee G., is S.S.'s maternal grandmother.
Renee obtained custody of S.S. and her siblings in 2013 as
a result of domestic violence and E.C.'s drug use.

<P20>Sharon S. was defendant's mother. N.S. is defendant's brother.

<HN02><EMB>II. The Criminal Charges and Conviction</EMB>

<P20>By a seven-count amended information filed on April 15, 2016,
defendant was charged as follows:

<P20>Counts 1 and 2: Lewd acts upon Melissa between March 6, 2001,
and March 5, 2004 (Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a)).

<P20>Count 3: Lewd act upon Melissa between March 6, 2001, and
March 6, 2006 (Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a)).

<P20>Count 4: Continuous sexual abuse of Melissa between March 
6, 1997, and March 5, 2001 (Pen. Code, &sect; 288.5, subd. (a)).

<P20>Count 5: Lewd act upon S.S. between January 1, 2014, and March
31, 2014 (Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a)).<fnr3>

<P20>The information also contained a special allegation that defendant
committed an offense specified in Penal Code section 667.61,
subdivision (c), against more than one victim under section
667.61, subdivision (b). Defendant pled not guilty and denied
the special allegation.

<P20>In July 2016, a jury convicted defendant on counts 1 through
5, and found true the special allegation (Pen. Code, &sect;
667.61, subd. (c)). In August 2023, defendant was sentenced
to an aggregate term of 75 years to life in state prison.
This appeal followed.

<HN02><EMB>III. Factual Background</EMB>

<HN24><EMB>A. The Prosecution's Evidence</EMB>

<HN46><EMB>1. Melissa</EMB>

<P20>Melissa was 23 years old at the time of trial and living in
Arizona. Melissa had lived with both her parents, defendant
and Yolanda, until she was four years old, when Yolanda moved
out with Melissa and Anabell. After moving out, Melissa had
regular weekly and, later, monthly visits with defendant,
sometimes accompanied by Yolanda.

<P20>Melissa's testimony regarding the timing and circumstances
of defendant's sexual abuse when she was very young contained
some inconsistencies. She testified that, on one occasion
during the first year after Yolanda and Melissa moved out,
defendant took Melissa and Yolanda to Sharon's home. He and
Yolanda went into a bedroom, while Melissa stayed in the living
room watching television. Sharon was in the kitchen. Defendant
was naked when he emerged from the bedroom. Melissa recalled
defendant often walked around naked. Defendant sat next to
Melissa and offered to show her a turtle in Sharon's bathroom.
In the bathroom, defendant told Melissa to put her hand on
his penis, then placed his hand over hers and made her move
her hand back and forth across his penis. Melissa thought
defendant's penis "was gross. It was . . . wet." Sharon came into
the bathroom and she and defendant argued, and Sharon sent
Melissa back to the living room. Defendant went back into
the bedroom with Yolanda, who left with Melissa a few minutes
later.

<P20>After that incident, Melissa said that touching defendant's
penis "became like a recurrent thing," which defendant made
her do "once every other time" during their then-weekly visits.
Later, when her visits with defendant became monthly, Melissa
was forced to touch defendant's penis during "every other [visit]."
Melissa estimated that defendant made her touch his penis
six to eight times between the ages of four and five years
old, always while at Sharon's house.

<P20>Once, when Melissa was eight or nine years old, defendant
"picked [her] up and there was a little girl [whom Melissa later
learned was her half sister Angelica] in the back in a car
seat." Defendant took both girls to what Melissa thought was
his apartment. He took the girls into a pink room containing
toys or knick-knacks and said the room was Melissa's bedroom.
Melissa described the room as a "princess" room because it
was pink. While Melissa sat in the room with Angelica, defendant
was undressed. He instructed Melissa "to grab [Angelica's] hand
and . . . put it on [his penis]." After the baby cried and jerked
him, defendant "snatched her" up and took her out of the room.
When defendant returned to the bedroom his penis was erect,
and he forced his penis into Melissa's vagina. Melissa testified
that "it hurt a lot." "[She] was bleeding afterwards . . . ." That was
the last time Melissa saw Angelica.

<P20>The last molestation Melissa recalled occurred
when she was about 12 or 13 years old. Yolanda brought Melissa
back to California for a visit after they moved to Arizona.
Defendant drove them in his truck to what Yolanda said was
"a secret park." Melissa was left alone inside while defendant
and Yolanda had sex "on the side of the truck." Afterwards,
they returned to the same apartment where defendant previously
had forced sexual intercourse upon Melissa. Melissa was afraid
and hid in a closet. Defendant coaxed her out and soothed
her. Melissa recalls sitting on the bed with defendant, then
lying down on the bed with headphones on staring at the wall
while defendant "raped [her]." Melissa fell asleep and woke
up to Yolanda, who was angry with Melissa, told the child
she "was bad," and said they were never going to see defendant
again. Defendant was on the bed next to Melissa and covered
himself with a blanket. Melissa did not remember if Yolanda
confronted him.

<P20>At trial, Melissa also testified that the first time that
defendant raped her she was in elementary school but does
not know which one or exactly what age she was. Defendant
picked her up from school, took her to the beach and then
back to the same Los Angeles area apartment to which they
had gone after the "park thing." Defendant was very nice to
Melissa, told her he cared a lot about her and loved her very
much, and had shown her how much he cared. In the bedroom,
defendant removed his own clothes, then took off Melissa's
clothing and laid her on the bed. Melissa testified that she
fought a little, but defendant said if she stayed still and
calm it would be over quickly, and it was. The next thing
"[Melissa] remember[ed she] was bleeding" from her vagina. After
defendant raped Melissa, "he got [her] dressed and then [they]
left." When she returned home, Melissa had blood on her underwear,
school skirt and bedsheets. Yolanda, who thought Melissa had
begun to menstruate, hit her for not telling Yolanda she had
started her period. She told Melissa she was a "whore" and
a "bitch," and "grounded" her. Melissa did not tell her mother
what defendant had done because she did not want Yolanda to
hit her again. Melissa never revealed defendant's sexual abuse
to anyone before she was contacted by police in connection
with this case, even after she began seeing the first of five
therapists at age 16 or 17. At the time, Yolanda-from whom
Melissa is estranged&mdash;was "beating" Melissa daily, and
"grilled [her] about what exactly [she] was supposed to tell
the therapist."

<P20>Melissa never met defendant's second wife, Maribel, but saw
his third wife, E.C., on three occasions when she visited
as an adult and stayed with E.C. and defendant. She got to
know her half siblings when she visited defendant and E.C.
for several days and also saw her grandmother, Sharon. Melissa
had gotten in contact with Sharon because defendant had more
children and Melissa wanted to know if they were okay and
if defendant had changed. Despite what he had done to her,
Melissa still wanted a relationship with defendant because
she "ha[d] no parents" and 60 percent of the time he "was nice"
and "actually cared."

<P20>As an adult, Melissa took an ocean-boating trip with defendant
and his brother N.S. for two days. She stayed near N.S. and
away from defendant the whole time.

<HN46><EMB>2. S.S.</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>a. DCFS's Investigation</EMB>

<P20>Catherine Maresca was a social worker and an emergency response
person for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and
Family Services (DCFS). On May 8, 2014, Maresca visited the
home of S.S.'s maternal grandmother, Renee, to investigate
a referral regarding S.S. S.S.'s mother, E.C., was not present.
Maresca spoke alone with S.S., then three years old. Maresca
asked S.S. about "what appeared to be a cold sore or some kind
of outbreak on her upper lip." S.S. told her that defendant
"also has those," and said something about she and defendant
"touching . . . each other's private parts." S.S. said "that it happened
sometimes [when defendant] would [suck] on her with his tongue."

<P20>Maresca asked Renee if S.S. ever mentioned anything about
inappropriate incidents with defendant. Renee told her S.S.
said something "once . . . [a]nd that [Renee] had just kind of left
it alone . . . ." Maresca deemed it necessary to have a forensic interview
conducted of S.S. because of potential sexual abuse. Nicole
Farrell, director of a child abuse assessment program and
an expert in "forensic interview technique, child trauma treatment,
and memory and suggestibility" interviewed S.S. alone: once
in May 2014&mdash;when S.S. was age three&mdash;and again
in January 2015.
 

<P20>During the first interview, S.S. told Farrell that defendant
"stick[s] his finger in [her] butt" and moved his finger around. 
S.S. clarified that she was referring to her vagina. The incidents
occurred in Sharon's bathroom. In their second interview,
S.S. told Farrell that defendant did "bad stuff to [her]." She
repeated that defendant "stick[s] his finger in my butt" and
moved his finger around. S.S. also said defendant "was touching
his butt too," and demonstrated that, what she meant was that
defendant stroked his penis. S.S. recalled the molestation
happened several times.

<P20>S.S. also told Farrell that defendant hit her with a belt
"super hard," and made her cry. S.S. said defendant also hit
E.C. with a belt and had threatened to hit E.C. in the head
with a hammer. Farrell showed the child pictures of the human
body, and S.S. indicated on the picture that her reference
to her "[f]ront booty," meant her vagina.

<HN68><EMB>b. S.S.'s Trial Testimony</EMB>

<P20>S.S. was five years old when she testified at trial. She said
no one had coached her about what to say in court. S.S. testified
that defendant used to make her uncomfortable because he touched
her vagina ("front butt") with his finger when she was naked.
He used his index finger and moved it in a circular motion
while simultaneously stroking his penis. The molestation took
place in Sharon's bathroom. S.S. did not tell E.C. about the
incidents until after defendant was later arrested.

<HN46><EMB>3. Section 1108 Evidence of Defendant's Molestation of Angelica</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>a. At Trial, Angelica Had No Memory of Defendant's Sexual
Molestation of Her When She Was a Toddler</EMB>

<P20>Angelica was age 16 at the time of trial and had not seen
defendant since she was five years old. Her foster parents
were Mr. and Mrs. G. Angelica met S.S. once when S.S. was
a newborn.

<P20>Angelica had no memory of speaking to DCFS therapists.
She remembered that her mother, Maribel, told her defendant
was "not a good person," but did not remember anything about
the things that had taken place between herself and defendant
when she was very young.

<HN68><EMB>b. Maribel Recalled Angelica Telling Her Defendant
Molested her, and Personally Witnessed
Him Engage in an Act of Molestation</EMB>

<P20>Maribel lost custody of Angelica for about six months when
the child was two or three years old. She and defendant were
in a custody dispute and defendant accused Maribel of beating
Angelica.

<P20>After Maribel regained custody of Angelica in April 2003,
Angelica asked her mother if she, meaning Angelica, was ugly
or dirty. Maribel said no; Angelica "was a princess." Angelica
told her mother that defendant "was a monster and that she
was afraid of him." She said they would touch one another;
he "would make her do things, and that he would touch her and
that she would touch him." Angelica had specified that she
and defendant touched one another's private parts, and Maribel
also recalled Angelica saying defendant made "her kiss his
thing."

<P20>Maribel testified that Angelica began acting out sexually
at age three. Once, when she and Angelica were on a bus the
three-year-old touched a stranger's penis over his pants.
She told Maribel that defendant "would teach her that." On
another occasion, the three-year-old was at a pay phone with
Maribel. As Maribel talked on the phone, Angelica "started
pretending that she was licking [her mother's] private parts."
When Maribel asked why she was doing that, Angelica "just looked
at [her]."

<P20>Maribel testified about an occasion when she had emerged from
a shower to see defendant manipulating Angelica's "privates"
with a Q-Tip. At the time, Angelica was less than two weeks
old. The child, who had been clothed when Maribel went into
the shower, was naked and asleep on a bed. Maribel saw defendant
trying to put a Q-Tip into Angelica's vagina and believed
that part of the swab penetrated the child. When she asked
him what he was doing, defendant said Angelica "`was dirty[.]'
"Maribel told defendant she did not think what he was doing
was normal, to which he responded that the baby was dirty
and needed to be cleaned. On an earlier occasion, defendant
wanted to have sex while Maribel was breastfeeding Angelica,
then 10 days old. Defendant asked Maribel, "`Why don't the three
[of] us do it?'"

<P20>Maribel knew defendant's third wife, E.C. She
saw E.C. about four times and met her children, but the women
were not friendly. Before S.S. was born, Maribel told E.C.
what Angelica had told her. Maribel warned E.C. not to trust
defendant because he had done things to Angelica. E.C. responded
that her children told her everything. Maribel never met Yolanda
or Melissa.

<HN68><EMB>c. Testimony of Angelica's Foster Parent</EMB>

<P20>Mr. G. served as Angelica's foster father for about six months
after Maribel temporarily lost custody. Once, in February
2003, Mr. G. went into Angelica's bedroom to check on the
three-year-old after she went to bed. He noticed that Angelica
"was covered with the blanket" and moving a lot and turned
on the lights. Angelica did not answer when Mr. G. asked what
she was doing. Angelica had worn pajamas to bed, but when
Mr. G. removed the blanket the child was naked and "touching
her private parts." He asked Angelica again what she was doing.
The child was frightened but "she just kept on quiet." When
Mr. G. asked Angelica again why she was touching herself,
the child said "she would do that with [defendant]." Mr. G.
reported the incident to DCFS. During the time he served as
Angelica's foster parent, Mr. G. dropped the child off for
weekly visits with defendant. Mr. G. did not see Angelica
again after she was returned to her mother's custody, and
did not know Melissa or E.C.

<HN68><EMB>d. Therapist's Work With Angelica Regarding Sexual
Abuse</EMB>

<P20>In 2003, Elyiria Arencibia was a marriage and family therapist
intern at an agency in Huntington Park. She worked primarily
with girls who were victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence.
Angelica, then about three years old, was one of the girls
with whom Arencibia worked. Angelica told Arencibia that defendant
had asked her to touch his "colita" (meaning "bottom" or "small
tail" in Spanish). Angelica also told Arencibia that defendant
had touched her "in the vaginal area," and asked her "to touch
his little tail." Maribel was present during Arencibia's sessions
with Angelica but did not tell the child what to say. Angelica
had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder "as a
result of sexual abuse."

<HN46><EMB>4. The Police Investigation</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>a. Detective Baskaron's Interviews of Melissa</EMB>

<P20>On June 9, 2014, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Detective
Edward Baskaron spoke with Melissa (who was living in Arizona)
by phone and confirmed that defendant was her father. Melissa
asked why the detective was asking about defendant and he
explained that he was investigating defendant's abuse of his
other children and "trying to verify if he [had] abused [Melissa] . . . ."
Melissa asked what defendant was accused of, and the detective
said, "Sexually fondling his young kids."

<P20>Detective Baskaron told Melissa that defendant had a three-year-old,
and Melissa said she knew about the young girl, and also knew
Angelica. Melissa asked if she could call the detective back
as she had "just recently come to the conclusion [that defendant
was sexually abusing his other children] and it [was] something
[she] need[ed] to absorb . . . ." Melissa told Baskaron she moved away
from defendant when she was five, had last seen him the preceding
January or February and knew that he sexually fondled young
children. She had reached this conclusion because she had
once seen Ashley emerge from a bathroom followed by defendant
who wore nothing but "a towel around his waist," and Melissa
"put two and two together."

<P20>When Baskaron called Melissa again on April 2, 2015, she asked
him to stop calling her. The detective explained that another
detective would be contacting her about a subpoena to come
to court and explained that she was required to comply with
the subpoena. Melissa said she did not plan to say anything
in court and the police should "respect [her] decision and leave
[her] out of it." The detective encouraged Melissa to cooperate
to help keep "somebody that should not be around children away
from children forever . . . ." Despite her initial reluctance to be
involved, Melissa eventually agreed to come to court and testify.

<P20>At trial, Melissa testified that during her second call with
Baskaron, she told the detective that defendant began touching
her when she was eight or nine in the bathroom. She remembers
being in elementary school when the first incident happened
and confirmed her memory of the "princess room." Melissa had
never told anyone about being sexually abused by defendant
until she told Baskaron. She lived in denial and was happier.
She had begun seeing the first of several therapists at age
16 and 17. She was unable to talk about the sexual abuse because
Yolanda beat her every day and grilled her about what to tell
the therapist.

<HN68><EMB>b. Detective Baskaron's Interview of Yolanda</EMB>

<P20>In early March 2015, Detective Baskaron called Yolanda and
asked if she had heard from Melissa; she had not. He interviewed
Yolanda who said Melissa had lived with her in Los Angeles
in 1993, but they moved around a lot, and she could not recall
where they were living when Melissa was seven or eight years
old. Yolanda said that Melissa occasionally stayed with Sharon,
her paternal grandmother between the ages of eight and 12
and, during those times, sometimes saw defendant.

<HN24><EMB>B. Defense Evidence</EMB>

<HN46><EMB>1. Sharon Denies Seeing Defendant Molest Melissa</EMB>

<P20>Defendant's mother, Sharon, believed that she saw Melissa
three or four times from the time she was born until Melissa
was seven or eight, when Yolanda and defendant asked her to
babysit. Sharon did not recall seeing Yolanda or Melissa between
2001 and 2004. Defendant was not present during Melissa's
visits, and Sharon never saw him molest Melissa. After Yolanda
and her daughters moved away, Sharon did not see Melissa again
until she was 19 or 20 and came from Arizona to visit.

<HN46><EMB>2. Defendant's Aunt Linda Rarely Saw Melissa</EMB>

<P20>Sharon and her sister, Linda A., celebrated all holidays together.
Linda first saw Melissa at Sharon's house on Thanksgiving
in 2000 and did not see her again until Melissa was 19 or
20 years old. Linda saw defendant once or twice a year from
1993 to 2002.

<HN46><EMB>3. Expert Witness Dr. Bradley McAuliff Explains
Suggestibility and Forensic Interviewing</EMB>

<P20>Dr. Bradley McAuliff is a professor of psychology and an expert
in "children's memories, suggestibility and forensic interviewing."
After being retained by defendant's counsel as an expert witness,
McAuliff reviewed Farrell's interviews of S.S., transcripts
of interviews of Melissa, preliminary hearing testimony by
S.S. and Melissa, police reports and DCFS records. McAuliff
did not personally interview anyone associated with the case.

<P20>McAuliff explained what suggestibility was in terms of the
integrity and accuracy of reporting by victims and witnesses,
and detailed various factors that affect suggestibility. He
addressed coaching child witnesses and noted that "all protocols
recommend interviewing kids by themselves." McAuliff was critical
of the way the interviews were conducted for various reasons
and testified about the propriety of the protocols used.

<HN46><EMB>4. N.S. Rarely Saw Melissa and Never Witnessed
Defendant Engage in Molestation</EMB>

<P20>Defendant's brother, N.S. believed that he saw Melissa twice
between 2000 and 2002, when he lived with his mother, Sharon.
He did not see Melissa again for about 10 years until she
accompanied N.S. and defendant on an overnight fishing trip.
He did not think Melissa acted skittish around defendant on
that trip.

<HN46><EMB>5. Defendant's Physical Abuse of Matthew</EMB>

<P20>Defendant was arrested in 2014. His son, Matthew, was present.
During a police interview the day after the arrest, Matthew
told police that defendant had headbutted him when he was
nine or 10 years old.

<P20>A couple of months after the headbutting incident, Matthew
was present during an arrest of defendant that involved a
police helicopter and squad cars. As the helicopter flew over
the car, defendant told Matthew to say that defendant was
taking him to the doctor. On that occasion, defendant had
not told Matthew where they were headed and Matthew was not
sick. Defendant had never taken Matthew to the doctor and
Matthew did not think he knew where his doctor's office was.
Matthew complied with defendant's instruction and told the
police he was going to the doctor. Matthew said that, although
defendant did not beat him, he was afraid of his father "[b]ecause
if he [got] mad he would yell and . . . push [Matthew's] mom and [him] . . . ."

<HN46><EMB>6. E.C., a Victim of Defendant's Domestic Abuse,
Lost Custody of Her Children Due to Her Drug
Abuse</EMB>

<P20>E.C., defendant's third wife, was involved with defendant
for 11 years beginning in January 2003. During the time they
lived together, E.C. was the victim of 20 domestic violence
incidents by defendant. She also saw defendant hit S.S. with
a belt, after which defendant also hit E.C. and threatened
to kill her with a hammer.

<P20>In 2003, E.C. monitored about five of defendant's
visits with Angelica; she did not see anything unusual. Between
2003 and 2005, E.C. estimated she took her children to Sharon's
house more than 50 times but never saw Melissa.

<P20>In late 2012, defendant reported E.C. to DCFS
for drug use. As a result, E.C. lost custody and her children
were placed with her mother, Renee. E.C. struggled with drug
addiction through 2014. In early 2013, she and defendant began
taking addiction courses and seeing a couples' therapist.
E.C. was unable to maintain her sobriety and defendant was
granted custody of the children in January 2014. Despite losing
custody, E.C. continued to live with defendant until the end
of 2014, when he told her to move out because she was still
using drugs. Less than a week later, defendant was arrested
at the gas station while E.C. and the children were in the
car. A few days after defendant's arrest, E.C. told DCFS that
defendant had been arrested because he had been driving drunk.

<P20>In March 2014, E.C. reported to the police that defendant
had beat the children the month before, using a belt and a
wooden stick. Defendant lost custody of the children. When
defendant was released from jail, he filed complaints with
DCFS that E.C. was using drugs. Just before a dependency hearing
in April 2014, E.C. told defendant he could stay with her
and the children.

<P20>On April 2, 2014, E.C. filed a police report accusing defendant
of having kidnapped Matthew. Defendant had taken Matthew after
telling E.C. and Renee they would never again see the kids.
E.C. told the police that defendant was on methamphetamine,
armed, and had threatened to shoot her sister in the head.
E.C. retracted her accusation a few days later. In May 2014,
shortly after E.C. reported that defendant was sexually abusing
S.S., defendant came to where E.C. and the children were staying
with her sister. Defendant tried to force his way into the
house. After E.C. let him in, defendant grabbed S.S. Afraid,
E.C. demanded that he let her go and defendant complied and
left.

<P20>E.C. knew that defendant had taken S.S. alone 10 to 20 times
to Sharon's house when S.S. was three or four years old. E.C.'s
mother, Renee, had told E.C. that defendant touched S.S. on
the buttocks about six months before the May 2014 sexual abuse
accusation. When E.C. asked Sharon about this accusation,
Sharon said it was not possible as she handled all the bathing
and diaper changing. E.C. did not speak with Melissa, Angelica
or Maribel after S.S. disclosed defendant's sexual abuse to
her mother in 2014. E.C. testified that she never told S.S.
what to say to the police or DCFS.

<HN46><EMB>7. Defendant's Roommate Never Saw Melissa</EMB>

<P20>Martin E. was defendant's roommate between 1998 and 2001,
and believed defendant was interested in adult females. Martin
never saw Melissa at the apartment he shared with defendant.
Martin worked days and did not see defendant for five or six
days each week.

<HN46><EMB>8. DCFS's Investigation of Allegations Against
E.C. and Defendant</EMB>

<P20>In 2013, Kymberly Cotton, a DCFS continuing services worker,
was assigned to defendant and E.C.'s case. At that time, both
parents had lost custody of the children due to allegations
of domestic violence and drug abuse. In October 2013, the
children were supposed to be living with E.C.'s mother, Renee.
Defendant claimed the children were actually living with E.C.,
which both Renee and the children denied. Cotton visited the
children on February 14, 2014. The children did not say they
had been beaten, and Cotton saw no bruising on Matthew's forehead
where defendant headbutted him. S.S. mentioned that defendant
struck her with a belt after he found her hiding under a bed.

<HN46><EMB>9. Renee Filed a False Report About Defendant Kidnapping
Matthew, and Talked to S.S. About the Molestation</EMB>

<P20>Renee obtained custody of Matthew, Ashley and S.S. in January
2013, and they lived with her for about a year before returning
to defendant.

<P20>Renee was the person who made a 911 call regarding Matthew's
alleged kidnapping. She later retracted that false report
and admitted she had not been present when defendant allegedly
took off with Matthew and threatened E.C. Renee testified
that several months before S.S. told Maresca about being molested,
S.S. told Renee that defendant "stuck his finger in her butt."
Renee shared that information with E.C.

<HN46><EMB>10. Police Confirm the False Kidnapping Report</EMB>

<P20>LAPD Sergeant Jeremy Ortiz responded to the 911 call regarding
Matthew's alleged kidnapping and took defendant into custody
after a traffic stop. Matthew was not in distress. Sergeant
Ortiz spoke with E.C. and Renee who said defendant had threatened
to kill E.C.'s sister and forcibly took Matthew. Later, both
E.C. and Renee admitted they had made a false report.

<HN46><EMB>11. Maribel Lost Custody of Angelica, and Knew
About the Molestation Accusations</EMB>

<P20>E.C. called Maribel to ask whether she had been contacted
by the police "because there was a problem with [E.C.'s] children."
Maribel explained that she had lost custody of Angelica after
the beating accusations, but defendant had not received custody
because he was a drug addict. That was "when things came to
light that [defendant] was touching the girl." Maribel said
defendant had been alone with Angelica many times until she
was about three years old. She recalled a conversation with
defendant's mother in 2001, during which Sharon warned Maribel
not to leave Angelica alone with defendant. Sharon told Maribel,
"[t]hey had a family secret and that [defendant] used to sexually
abuse . . . Melissa."

<HN46><EMB>12. Detective Baskaron's Contacts With the Victims</EMB>

<P20>Detective Baskaron knew E.C. contacted Maribel before he was
able to speak to Maribel. Initially, Maribel refused to let
Angelica speak with the detective.

<P20>Detective Baskaron then spoke with Melissa. He testified that
Melissa had said "her first memory" was being molested by defendant
when she was eight or nine years old. Later, Melissa told
a forensic interviewer she recalled incidents of molestation
as early as when she was four or five years old. The detective
testified that Melissa "had a lot of anxiety" about testifying
against defendant at trial; she had a panic attack, vomited
and "was completely terrified." At the courthouse, Melissa
collapsed and refused to enter the courtroom. The detective
said Melissa behaved similarly after arriving at the airport
from Arizona, "and just completely shut down." Melissa told
the detective she felt guilty about what defendant had done
to her siblings because she had not stopped him.

<HN24><EMB>C. Stipulations</EMB>

<P20>The parties stipulated that in March 2014, E.C.
met with a DCFS social worker and told her that, during a
phone call on February 28, 2014, Sharon told E.C. defendant
"had been arrested," and that Matthew, S.S. and Ashley were
with her. E.C. said defendant "had been arrested for driving
under the influence with the children in the car." E.C. also
told the social worker that, "a week before February 28, 2014
[defendant] had hit [S.S.] with a belt, and . . . Matthew told her
that he was hit by [defendant]." At that point, E.C. decided
to "report the physical abuse . . . because of [defendant's] being
under the influence with children in his care

<P20>The parties also stipulated that Renee met with
the same social worker in March 2014 and told her that E.C.
called her on February 28, 2014, to say that defendant had
been arrested. E.C. asked Renee to pick up the children. E.C.
told "her about the physical abuse . . . and a decision was made
to report the matter to [DCFS]." Renee denied having "any prior
knowledge of the physical abuse prior to [E.C.'s] informing
her."

<CN><EMB>DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>Defendant raises the following contentions of error: (1) The
trial court violated his constitutional rights to confrontation
and due process by admitting propensity evidence under Evidence
Code sections 1108 and 1360 in the form of statements Angelica
made to others around the time the molestation occurred, despite
the fact that Angelica was not a victim in this case, and
under section 352; (2) the trial court erred when it found
him mentally competent; (3) he received ineffective assistance
of counsel; (4) the court abused its discretion in denying
his motion for a new trial; and (5) the court violated his
constitutional right to be represented by retained counsel
of choice. We reject as meritless each of defendant's contentions.

<HN02><EMB>I. The Trial Court Did Not Err in Admitting Propensity
Evidence</EMB>

<P20>Angelica, 16 years old at the time of trial, had not seen
defendant since she was five and had no memories from when
she was three years old. It was stipulated that Angelica was
legally unavailable as a witness.

<P20>Over defendant's objection, the prosecution was permitted
to introduce propensity evidence pursuant to Evidence Code
sections 352, 1108 and 1360, through testimony by Angelica's
mother, a DCFS social worker, Angelica's foster parent, and
a therapist to whom Angelica made comments indicating defendant
molested her when she was about three years old. Defendant
initially maintains that the trial court erred in admitting
evidence that he molested Angelica under section 1360 because
Angelica was not a "victim" in this case, and testimony by
her mother and the social worker was admitted "not to corroborate
Angelica's testimony but to corroborate Melissa's testimony."
He also argues that the evidence was unduly prejudicial and
therefore inadmissible under section 352.

<HN24><EMB>A. Relevant Proceedings</EMB>

<P20>On June 7, 2016, defendant's counsel moved to exclude Angelica's
prior statements arguing the evidence was inadmissible because
the prosecutor could not lay the requisite foundation. Counsel
noted that Angelica did not remember any sexual abuse perpetrated
against her by defendant and statements she had made indicating
such conduct in the past were made in response to a therapist's
questions. The prosecutor sought to introduce statements Angelica
made to her mother, a social worker, her foster parent and
a therapist about the molestations in 2003, under Evidence
Code sections 352, 1101, 1108 and 1360.

<P20>Defense counsel argued that the issue was whether such evidence
should be admitted because it was hearsay. In response, the
prosecution noted that the statements were admissible under
the hearsay exceptions of Evidence Code sections 1360 and
1108. Defense counsel argued that Angelica's statements should
not be admitted in evidence because they were not corroborated
by medical findings or other witnesses. The prosecution responded
that the statements were corroborated by the fact that, although
S.S. and Angelica never met, each had recounted stories of
very similar conduct by defendant when each girl had been
about the same age. The prosecution also argued that the evidence
was admissible in light of Melissa's testimony that, not only
did she experience the same conduct as Angelica described
to several people, Melissa was actually present when defendant
engaged in such conduct with Angelica.

<P20>Defense counsel then argued that the fact that allegations
by defendant's daughters were extremely similar rendered them
unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352. He also
suggested the girls' mothers may have collaborated because
they knew one another and Melissa knew E.C. In response, the
prosecution pointed out that Angelica's mother was uncooperative,
thus discrediting any suggestion that she was collaborating
with defendant's other wives. The trial court denied defendant's
request to exclude the evidence.

<P20>Defense counsel raised the issue again a few
days later, clarifying that his motion regarding the inadmissibility
of Angelica's statements included arguments under the confrontation
clause, the Sixth Amendment and unspecified due process claims.
Counsel stated that he was aware "of no law authorizing the
Court to use the allegations to which [Evidence Code section]
1108 is to be added as corroboration . . . ." The prosecution observed
that no corroboration was required under section 1108. Nevertheless,
Angelica's statements would be corroborated because the three-year-old
had acted out sexually in a manner both inappropriate for
a child her age and consistent with what defendant was alleged
to have done to her. The prosecution also stated that Angelica
was expected to testify and would be subject to cross-examination.
The court told defense counsel he could raise the issue again
after Angelica testified if she said she did not remember
what occurred. The court clarified that the evidence would
be limited to show intent pertaining to prior sexual acts
involving Angelica (&sect;&sect; 1101, subd. (b), 1108) and noted
it had engaged in the balancing required by section 352. Later,
addressing Angelica's potential testimony, the court asked
the prosecution how it would make Angelica available for cross-examination
if she was unable to remember events, and requested that the
parties research the issue.

<P20>On June 23, 2016, in a continued hearing on the motion under
Evidence Code section 1360, the trial court observed that
the statute "addresse[d] . . . the confrontation clause issue inasmuch
as it constitutes a firmly rooted hearsay exception," and
that Angelica's statements were not testimonial. The court
tentatively ruled "it would be appropriate to admit the statements
attributed to Angelica . . . ." The court explained that defendant's
"objection under the confrontation clause [did not] survive[]"
in light of section 1360. The parties agreed that Angelica's
statements to her mother and foster parent were not testimonial
and admitted those statements.

<P20>The trial court turned to the issue of what, if any, corroboration
was required to admit Angelica's statements under Evidence
Code section 1360. The prosecutor said the strongest corroboration
would be Melissa's testimony that she was present when defendant
directed her to show Angelica how to touch his penis. The
prosecutor noted that Melissa would testify that, not only
had she experienced the exact same conduct Angelica described
to Arencibia, she also had been present and personally witnessed
defendant do the same thing to Angelica. The court agreed
this was sufficient corroboration to satisfy section 1360.

<P20>After Angelica testified that she had no memory of defendant's
molestation, the parties stipulated, and the trial court agreed,
that she was legally unavailable. After a voir dire examination
of Arencibia, defense counsel renewed his motion to exclude
her testimony. He asserted there was no assurance that Angelica's
accusations were genuine, because Maribel was present during
the therapist's sessions with Angelica. The prosecution argued
that defendant's argument went to the weight of the evidence,
not its admissibility. The court rejected defendant's argument
and permitted Arencibia to testify.

<HN24><EMB>B. Evidence of Angelica's Statements Was Not Improperly Admitted
Under Evidence Code Section 1360</EMB>

<P20>Defendant argues that admission of Angelica's
extrajudicial statements under Evidence Code section 1360
violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair
trial, but on precisely what basis is unclear, as none of
the headings or subheadings clearly sets forth the grounds
for this argument.

<P20>In his opening brief, defendant argues that
Angelica was not a victim in the instant case and that Angelica's
statements to others were wrongly admitted via Evidence Code
section 1360 not to corroborate Angelica's testimony, but
Melissa's. This argument is located in the middle of a subheading
entitled "The Applicable Law" under a main heading that the
court's admission of this evidence "violated [defendant]'s Fifth
and Sixth Amendment Rights to Due Process and a Fair Trial."

<P20>The People contend defendant forfeited his contention that
Angelica's statements were improperly admitted because she
was not a victim in this case when he failed to object on
that specific basis at trial. Defendant does not dispute that
his counsel failed to argue that the challenged statements
were inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1360 because
Angelica was not a victim in this case.<fnr4>

<P20>A criminal judgment cannot be set aside on the basis of erroneously
admitted evidence unless a timely objection was made at trial
setting forth a "clear" and "specific ground" for the objection.
(Evid. Code, &sect; 353, subd. (a); <EM>People v. Partida</EM>
(2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 435 [the objection must "inform the trial
court, as well as the party offering the evidence, of the
specific reason or reasons the objecting party believes the
evidence should be excluded, so the party offering the evidence
can respond appropriately and the court can make a fully informed
ruling"]; accord, <EM>People v. Seijas</EM> (2005) 36 Cal.4th
291, 302.)

<P20>Here, defendant did not object on the specific ground now
raised on appeal. Rather, his counsel objected that Angelica's
statements were inadmissible because there were no medical
findings or witnesses to corroborate them. Later, defendant's
counsel clarified that his objection was also based on "<EM>Crawford</EM>
[<EM>v. Washington</EM> (2004) 541 U.S. 36,] the
confrontation clause, . . . the 6th Amendment[,] any other federal
due process claims" and Evidence Code section 352.

<P20>We agree with the People that, having failed to raise this
specific objection at trial to permit the trial court to rule
on that basis, defendant has forfeited the opportunity to
argue on appeal that evidence of what Angelica told others
was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1360 because
she was not a named victim. To the extent the defendant contended
there was any other basis for concluding the admission of
the evidence was erroneous under that section, that argument
has been forfeited for failure to clearly articulate the ground
for such an argument. (See <EM>Bitner v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation</EM> (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1065 ["`Failure
to provide proper headings forfeits issues that may be discussed
in the brief but are not clearly identified by a heading'"];
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204, subd. (a)(1)(B).)

<HN24><EMB>C. Any Error Was Harmless in the Face of Overwhelming
Evidence of Defendant's Guilt</EMB>

<P20>In any event, even if we assume the trial court misapplied
Evidence Code section 1360, any error in admitting Angelica's
statements was harmless. Violations of the right to confrontation
are subject to federal harmless error analysis under <EM>Chapman
v. California</EM> (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24. (<EM>Delaware v.
Van Arsdall</EM> (1986) 475 U.S. 673, 681.) "Since <EM>Chapman,</EM>
[courts] have repeatedly reaffirmed the principle that an otherwise
valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing
court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." (<EM>Ibid.</EM>)

<P20>Here, the introduction of Angelica's out-of-court statements
did not prejudice defendant as they were cumulative to the
damning trial testimony given by Melissa and S.S. In light
of independent and overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt,
it is not reasonably probable that the exclusion of Angelica's
nontestimonial evidence would have changed the outcome here.
The record contains testimony by Melissa about multiple grave
acts of child abuse and includes corroborating testimony that
she personally witnessed defendant engage in the same conduct
with Angelica as he had committed against her. In addition,
the record contains testimony by S.S. and evidence of her
statements to Maresca and Farrell regarding defendant's multiple
acts of molestation against her which substantially mirrored
conduct described by Angelica and occurred when each child
was about the same age. In short, the evidence of defendant's
guilt in this case was not merely substantial, but overwhelming.
On this record, any error in admitting Angelica's allegations
of abuse was harmless.

<HN24><EMB>D. The Trial Court Acted Within Its Discretion Under Evidence
Code Section 352</EMB>

<P20>Defendant asserts the Evidence Code section 1108 evidence
was inadmissible under section 352, because it "was not properly
used to corroborate Melissa, it was cumulative to the evidence
involving [S.S.], and it's [<EM>sic</EM>] admission consumed
a disproportionate portion of the trial." We disagree.

<P20>Courts have identified various factors trial courts should
consider to determine whether propensity evidence should be
excluded under Evidence Code section 352. These factors include:
"(1) whether the propensity evidence has probative value, e.g.,
whether the uncharged conduct is similar enough to the charged
behavior to tend to show the defendant did in fact commit
the charged offense; (2) whether the propensity evidence is
stronger and more inflammatory than evidence of the defendant's
charged acts; (3) whether the uncharged conduct is remote or
stale; (4) whether the propensity evidence is likely to confuse
or distract the jurors from their main inquiry, e.g., whether
the jury might be tempted to punish the defendant for his
uncharged, unpunished conduct; and (5) whether admission of
the propensity evidence will require an undue consumption
of time." (<EM>People v. Nguyen</EM> (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th
1096, 1117.)

<P20>Evidence of uncharged sexual conduct is inadmissible if, under
Evidence Code section 352, its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the probability that its admission creates a
substantial danger of prejudice, confusion of the issues,
may mislead the jury or consume an undue amount of time. (&sect;&sect;
352, 1108, subd. (a).) The probative value of uncharged sexual
conduct evidence is increased by the relative similarity between
the charged and uncharged acts, a close proximity in time
between the charged and uncharged acts, and the independent
sources of evidence in each offense. (<EM>People v. Falsetta</EM>
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 917.) We review a trial court's determination
under section 352 for abuse of discretion. (<EM>People v. Avila</EM>
(2014) 59 Cal.4th 496, 515.)

<P20>Here, the trial court expressly stated it had
"engage[d] in the balancing . . . required under [Evidence Code section]
352 . . . ." The conclusion it reached after conducting that analysis
was sound. First, the evidence was not unduly inflammatory
given the similarly graphic testimony by Melissa and S.S.
of defendant's acts against them. All three girls were defendant's
minor daughters of a similar age at the time of the alleged
molestation, evidence that indicates he was sexually attracted
to his young daughters. (<EM>People v. Holford</EM> (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 155, 185-186.) The evidence showed that defendant
took advantage of at least three of his young daughters when
left alone with them. (<EM>People v. Soto</EM> (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th
966, 991.) Finally, given its importance in the case, the
admission of evidence related to Angelica did not consume
an undue amount of time. (See, e.g., <EM>People v. Frazier</EM>
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 30, 42 [no abuse of discretion to admit
evidence of uncharged offenses that consumed 27 percent of
trial transcript].)

<P20>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting
the evidence under Evidence Code section 352. The highly probative
value of the uncharged conduct evidence prejudiced defendant,
but not unduly so. (<EM>People v. Branch</EM> (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
274, 286 ["`The prejudice that section 352 "`is designed to avoid
is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally
flows from relevant, highly probative evidence'"'"].)

<HN02><EMB>II. Substantial Evidence Negates Defendant's Contention that
He Was Not Competent to Stand Trial or To Be Sentenced</EMB>

<P20>Defendant argues that the record contains insufficient evidence
from which the trial court could have determined he was competent
to stand trial or sentencing proceedings. He is mistaken.

<HN24><EMB>A. Relevant Proceedings</EMB>

<P20>In June 2016, during an evidentiary hearing, the trial court
said defendant's "body language is driving me nuts right now."
The court had seen defendant's "counsel waive [<EM>sic</EM>]
[him] off many, many times. This is the last time I'm going
to do this . . . . I will advise you that you need to calm down."
Defendant responded that he had not received his medication.
The court said defendant's conduct was distracting and would
"not . . . bode well . . . in front of . . . jurors," and admonished him to "be
more aware of [his] behavior . . . ."

<P20>On July 6, 2016, defense counsel Conley told the trial court
defendant had not received his medication the night before.
The court instructed counsel to submit a medical order directing
prison officials to dispense defendant's medication. On August
29, 2016, following defendant's conviction, his trial counsel
sought the appointment of a psychiatrist "to prepare a confidential
report concerning whether the denial of psychotropic medications
during trial impaired [his] ability to assist counsel." The
court granted the motion and appointed Dr. Jack Rothberg.

<P20>On September 29, 2016, defendant told the trial court he wanted
to submit a letter regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.
He requested a <EM>Marsden</EM> hearing, which was conducted
on October 28, 2016.

<P20><SUP>5</SUP> A second <EM>Marsden</EM> hearing was conducted on December
7, 2016, after defendant again requested the appointment of
new defense counsel due to a serious "conflict of interest".

<P20>The court denied the <EM>Marsden</EM> motion. However, after
denying the motion, the trial court expressed its own doubt
regarding defendant's mental competence and suspended the
proceedings. At the request of defense counsel, the court
appointed experts to evaluate defendant.

<P20>In early February 2017, the prosecution advised the court
that defendant refused to cooperate or participate in an interview
with the prosecution's expert, appointed to evaluate defendant's
competence. The court admonished defendant but he remained
uncooperative and the prosecution's expert was unable to prepare
a report.

<P20>Dr. Gordon Plotkin, the appointed defense expert, completed
his evaluation on March 22, 2017. He concluded defendant "[was]
competent and [had been] competent at the time of the trial . . . ."
Dr. Plotkin noted that defendant's medications had been administered
but that he had "refused occasional doses of medication" and,
at one point, was "hoarding medications and refusing mouth
checks . . . ." Dr. Plotkin's report detailed calls defendant made
from jail in 2016, in which he discussed details of his case
in depth, including witness testimony, 911 calls, a plea deal,
evidentiary rulings, discussions with defense counsel, appeals,
witness credibility, closing arguments, the retention of private
counsel and a potential mistrial. Dr. Plotkin also reported
that he had spoken with defendant regarding "his number of
strikes," and defendant had responded with a "complex explanation[]
of <EM>Miranda</EM> Rights . . . ." (See <EM>Miranda v. Arizona</EM>
(1966) 384 U.S. 436.) Dr. Plotkin opined that defendant
was "manipulating and malingering, especially due to the high
likelihood of secondary gain, being convicted of an offense
that [would] cause him to be in prison for many years." Dr.
Plotkin further reported that defendant's "ability to discuss
the court process and understand the nature of the proceedings,
[was] clearly present," and defendant was "clearly feigning
symptoms of a mental disorder in an attempt to suggest that
he [was unable to] cooperate with counsel." Dr. Plotkin concluded
any potential difficulty defendant had in cooperating with
his attorney was "volitional on [defendant's] account, and/or
the result of attempting to manipulate or feign symptoms of
a mental disorder which would interfere with his cooperation."

<P20>In late March 2017, the prosecution informed the trial court
that defendant continued to refuse to be evaluated by its
expert. With the parties' consent, the court continued the
matter.

<P20>On April 14, 2017, defendant failed to appear. The trial court
stated that it was "in receipt of an inmate court refusal form . . . . The
reason for refusal states, `he is going man-down and could
not attend court. Inmate denied medical attention. Needs court
order.'" At the prosecution's request, the trial court ordered
Dr. Plotkin to appear with his report and evaluation of defendant's
competency.

<P20>The trial court received Dr. Plotkin's evaluation on May 12,
2017. The prosecutor informed the court that Dr. Plotkin had
found defendant competent, and that defendant consistently
refused to cooperate with the prosecution's expert. Defendant's
counsel said defendant no longer wanted a competency trial
solely in connection with sentencing, but also wanted one
regarding his competency at trial. The prosecution opined
defendant was engaging in "delay tactics," and pointed out
Plotkin had concluded defendant was competent at the time
of trial.

<P20>On May 12, 2017, the trial court conducted a third <EM>Marsden</EM>
hearing. It then appointed Tracy Grayson as defendant's new
counsel.

<P20>On December 6, 2018, the parties convened again
to address the outstanding competency issue. The prosecution
observed that it had heard nothing from defense counsel or
the court for two years. The parties agreed the issue was
whether defendant was competent in the past not the present,
an assertion with which the trial court concurred absent evidence
that defendant was presently incompetent. The court indicated
that it needed to determine what information was available
regarding defendant's competency in 2016 when it had expressed
its doubt on that issue and asked the parties to review the
matter.

<P20>The parties appeared on April 29, 2019, and
requested that the trial court again appoint experts on the
issue of competency. The court granted the prosecution's request
that Dr. Plotkin be reappointed, and defendant's request for
the appointment of Dr. Knapke (who was later replaced by Dr.
Robert Schug).

<P20>At a hearing on July 22, 2020, the prosecution
reminded the trial court that Dr. Plotkin had previously found
that defendant was competent at the time of trial. The prosecution
noted that Dr. Schug initially had declared defendant incompetent.
However, after reviewing his jail calls in 2019, Schug changed
his opinion and found that defendant was competent. The prosecution
explained that defendant's calls included having "[sought] legal
counsel, and basically explaining his case with exact recall
of the facts . . . and explaining he's innocent . . . ." The court requested
the calls for its own review.

<P20>At a hearing on August 11, 2020, the trial court said it had
reviewed the phone calls. It noted Dr. Schug had changed his
opinion, had found defendant "competent, and . . . suggest[ed defendant]
might be malingering." Although defense counsel characterized
Schug's opinion as merely "vacillating," the court found Schug's
opinion, coupled with the opinions expressed in Dr. Plotkin's
earlier report led to the conclusion that defendant was competent.
The proceedings were reinstated.

<P20>At a June 23, 2021 hearing on defendant's motion
for new trial, the prosecution pointed out defendant was nodding
in response to comments by his counsel, and asked that the
record reflect the nodding given the previous controversy
regarding defendant's competency. Shortly thereafter, defendant
made a "scene," and asked to leave the courtroom. The trial
court observed that defendant's unruly conduct began "exactly
when [the prosecution] pointed out that [he had been] nodding
and continued to nod after that and worked himself into whatever
that last scene was when he left." The court expressed its
view that defendant's "credibility . . . during trial," was "less
than sincere," and nothing had since occurred since then to
raise his level of credibility. Indeed, the court said defendant's
credibility was "probably" declining because of the "stunts
that he is pulling today." The court observed defendant had
"demonstrat[ed] a lot of things that the court [found] to be
fake and . . . disingenuous, and . . . insulting . . . ."

<P20>Defendant filed a fourth <EM>Marsden</EM> motion
on October 5, 2021.

<P20>The court noted defendant was pressuring his "attorney to do
the impossible," but granted the <EM>Marsden</EM> motion.

<P20>Defendant submitted a fifth <EM>Marsden</EM> motion on March
16, 2023.

<P20>After the court explained the parameters of
a motion for new trial, defendant expressed his understanding
and said he would cooperate with counsel.

<P20>Defendant filed a sixth <EM>Marsden</EM> motion
on April 26, 2023, which he withdrew in June. Defendant was
"a missout" on August 4, 2023, the date set for hearing on
his motion for a new trial.

<P20>On August 18, 2023, defendant submitted a seventh <EM>Marsden</EM>
motion.

<HN24><EMB>B. Controlling Legal Principles and the Standard
of Review</EMB>

<P20>Both federal due process and state law prohibit trying a criminal
defendant who is mentally incompetent. (<EM>People v. Ary</EM>
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 510, 517 (<EM>Ary</EM>).) When a trial court
is presented with evidence raising a reasonable doubt about
a defendant's mental competence to stand trial, principles
of due process require that proceedings be suspended and a
hearing be held to determine the defendant's competence. (<EM>Ibid.;
People v. Rogers</EM> (2006) 39 Cal.4th 826,
847 (<EM>Rogers</EM>) [trial court must suspend proceedings
and conduct a competency hearing if it is presented with substantial
evidence of incompetence, that is, evidence that raises a
reasonable doubt concerning the defendant's competence to
stand trial]; <EM>People v. Young</EM> (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149,
1216 [if a defendant produces substantial evidence of incompetence,
"`due process requires that a full competence hearing be held
as a matter of right'" and the trial judge has "`no discretion
to exercise'"].) "A defendant is deemed competent to stand trial
only if he `"has sufficient present ability to consult with
his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding"'
and `"has a rational as well as factual understanding of the
proceedings against him."'" (<EM>Ary,</EM> at p. 517, quoting
<EM>Dusky v. United States</EM> (1960) 362 U.S. 402, 402.)

<P20>"A defendant is mentally incompetent [to stand trial] if, as
a result of a mental health disorder or developmental disability,
the defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal
proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense
in a rational manner." (Pen. Code, &sect; 1367, subd. (a).) "Only
upon a determination that the defendant is mentally competent
may the matter proceed to trial." (<EM>Ary, supra,</EM> 51
Cal.4th at p. 517.)

<P20>These principles are codified in Penal Code section 1367 which
precludes a mentally incompetent defendant's criminal trial
or sentencing. (<EM>People v. Mickel</EM> (2016) 2 Cal.5th 181,
194-195 (<EM>Mickel</EM>); accord, <EM>People v. Mendoza</EM>
(2016) 62 Cal.4th 856, 871 (<EM>Mendoza</EM>).) The statute
provides that, a "person shall not be tried or adjudged to
punishment . . . while that person is mentally incompetent. A defendant
is mentally incompetent . . . if, as a result of mental disorder . . . the
defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal
proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense
in a rational manner." (&sect; 1367, subd. (a); <EM>Mickel,</EM>
at p. 195 [defendant incompetent to stand trial if he lacks
a sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable
degree of rational understanding and a factual understanding
of the proceedings against him].)

<P20>Penal Code section 1367 is implemented by sections 1368, 1368.1,
and 1369, which generally provide that, if a doubt arises
in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the
defendant, the court shall order the question of the defendant's
mental competence be determined at a hearing after the defendant
has been examined by an appropriate expert appointed by the
court. Section 1368 requires a trial court to suspend criminal
proceedings if it reasonably doubts a defendant's mental competence.
(<EM>Id.,</EM> subd. (a).) A defendant may create reasonable doubt
through substantial evidence of mental incompetence, or the
trial court may raise the issue on its own. (<EM>Ary, supra,</EM>
51 Cal.4th at p. 517.) Substantial evidence is evidence that
raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant's competence
to stand trial. (<EM>People v. Frye</EM> (1998) 18 Cal.4th 894,
951-952, disapproved on another ground by <EM>People v. Doolin</EM>
(2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 417-418 & fn. 2.) "Evidence of incompetence
may emanate from several sources, including the defendant's
demeanor, irrational behavior, and prior mental evaluations." (<EM>Rogers, supra,</EM>
39 Cal.4th at p. 847.) "`More is required
than just bizarre actions or statements by the defendant to
raise a doubt of competency.'" (<EM>People v. Buenrostro</EM>
(2018) 6 Cal.5th 367, 409-410 (<EM>Buenrostro</EM>); <EM>People
v. Ghobrial</EM> (2018) 5 Cal.5th 250, 270 (<EM>Ghobrial</EM>).)

<P20>"If, after a competency hearing, the defendant is found competent
to stand trial, a trial court may rely on that finding unless
the court `"is presented with a substantial change of circumstances
or with new evidence" casting a serious doubt on the validity
of that finding.'" (<EM>People v. Rodas</EM> (2018) 6 Cal.5th
219, 231.) A defendant is presumed to be mentally competent
unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that
he is mentally incompetent. (Pen. Code, &sect; 1369, subd. (c)(3);
<EM>People v. Campbell</EM> (1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 599, 608 (<EM>Campbell</EM>).)
Defendant bears the burden to prove that he is mentally incompetent
to stand trial. (<EM>People v. Stanley</EM> (1995) 10 Cal.4th
764, 817 (<EM>Stanley</EM>); see Cal. Rules of Court, rule
4.130(e)(2) ["defendant is presumed to be mentally competent,
and it is the burden of the party contending that the defendant
is not mentally competent to prove the defendant's mental
incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence"].) In determining
mental competence within the meaning of section 1368, the
standard applied is whether "the defendant [is] capable of understanding
the nature and purpose of the proceedings taken against him;
does he comprehend his own status and condition in reference
to such proceedings; is he capable to assist his attorney
in conducting his defense . . . in a rational manner?" (<EM>Campbell,</EM>
at p. 608.)

<P20>On appeal, the court's finding on the issue of competency
to stand trial will not be disturbed if it is supported by
substantial and credible evidence. (<EM>Campbell, supra,</EM>
63 Cal.App.3d at p. 608.)

<HN24><EMB>C. Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court's
Finding that Defendant Was Competent to Stand Trial
and for Sentencing Proceedings</EMB>

<P20>Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the judgment
and presuming in support of the judgment the existence of
every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from
the evidence (see <EM>Campbell, supra,</EM> 63 Cal.App.3d at
p. 608), we conclude defendant's competency to stand trial
is clearly established on this record.<fnr6>
Our review of the record reveals substantial evidence supports
the court's conclusion that defendant was and remained competent
throughout the trial and posttrial proceedings.

<P20>First, defendant's trial counsel characterized defendant as
highly intelligent and cooperative throughout the proceedings.
The attorney informed the trial court that defendant "reads
everything. He gets additional sources of information. He
bombards you with it in the middle of your cross examination."
In the past, counsel had represented clients who suffered
from schizophrenia. (<EM>People v. Turner</EM> (2004) 34 Cal.4th
406, 425 [evidence establishing the defendant and his attorneys
could adequately communicate, despite some problems, and the
defendant could adequately assist in defense was sufficient
to support finding of competency].)

<P20>Second, defendant's own conduct reinforced his counsel's belief
in his mental competence. In his initial <EM>Marsden</EM>
request and supporting letter, defendant outlined the precise
reasons why he believed he had received ineffective assistance
of counsel. It was not until after his conviction that defendant
began to make bizarre statements or claim a preexisting mental
health disorder which, standing alone, are insufficient to
indicate incompetence. "`More is required than just bizarre
actions or statements by the defendant to raise a doubt of
competency.'" (<EM>Buenrostro, supra,</EM> 6 Cal.5th at pp.
409-410; <EM>Ghobrial, supra,</EM> 5 Cal.5th at p. 270.)

<P20>Third, the trial court went to great lengths to ensure defendant
was not merely manipulating the system by feigning incompetence.

<P00>During one posttrial hearing, the court described defendant's
"credibility . . . during trial, [as] less than sincere," and observed
nothing had happened since trial to increase its opinion of
defendant's credibility. Indeed, the court said defendant's
credibility was "probably going lower when he pull[ed] stunts
that he is pulling today." The court went on to say defendant
had been demonstrating a lot of things the court found to
be "fake," "disingenuous," and "insulting." Nevertheless, conceding
some doubt and out of an abundance of caution, the trial court
appointed experts to evaluate defendant's mental competence.
An evaluation conducted by defendant's own expert, Dr. Plotkin,
confirmed the court's belief that defendant was competent.
Defendant consistently refused to cooperate with the prosecution's
appointed psychiatrist.

<P20>Finally, Dr. Plotkin's evaluation defeats defendant's argument.
Plotkin concluded defendant was currently "competent and was
competent at the time of the trial . . . ." Defendant argues a principal
reason he lacked competence to stand trial was because his
jailors failed to administer his medications. However, Dr.
Plotkin observed defendant "hoard[ed] medications and refus[ed]
mouth checks" and, on occasion, outright "refuse[d] . . . doses of
medication." Dr. Plotkin's report also detailed calls defendant
made from jail in 2016, in which he discussed details of his
case, including testimony, a possible plea deal, various evidentiary
rulings, discussions with counsel about testifying, appeals,
the credibility of witnesses, closing argument, retention
of private counsel and a potential mistrial. The doctor also
discussed defendant's "strikes" with him and received "complex
explanations of <EM>Miranda</EM> Rights . . . ." In the end, Dr. Plotkin
concluded defendant was "manipulating and malingering, especially
due to the high likelihood of secondary gain, being convicted
of an offense that will cause him to be in prison for many
years." The doctor also concluded defendant was "clearly feigning
symptoms of a mental disorder in an attempt to suggest that
he cannot cooperate with counsel . . . ." He concluded defendant's
"ability to discuss the court process and understand the nature
of the proceedings [was] clearly present," and "any potential
difficulty in cooperating with his attorney [was] volitional
on [defendant's] account, and/or the result of attempting to
manipulate or feign symptoms of a mental disorder which would
interfere with his cooperation." Dr. Schug, another defense
expert, also concluded defendant was competent.

<P20>Defendant claims his "medical history alone, plus the fact
that [he] could not get along with any of three different attorneys, . . . continuously
made <EM>Marsden</EM> motions, and during the
hearings acted as if he were pro per and [that] preparation
was his sole responsibility" rather than the responsibility
of his attorneys "should have alerted the court and counsel
that a competency inquiry was necessary[,] [so] he would have
had a chance to be restored to competence in time to cooperate
with his defense. . . ." In fact, the trial court did conclude that
a competency evaluation was in order. However, following an
extensive investigation over the course of several years (during
which defendant refused to cooperate with the prosecution's
expert), both of the defense's own expert evaluators found
him to be quite competent. On this record, the evidence strongly
supports the trial court's conclusion that defendant was malingering
and engaged in dilatory tactics in an effort to manipulate
the criminal justice system.

<HN02><EMB>III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</EMB>

<P20>Defendant asserts he received ineffective assistance of counsel
because, during his opening statement, Conley promised evidence
and witnesses he failed to deliver, failed early on to express
doubt regarding defendant's competence and request the proceedings
be suspended, and failed to ensure that defendant received
his medications.<fnr7> He contends, absent these
errors, he would have received a more favorable result at
trial. We disagree.

<P20>To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, (1) an attorney's
performance must fall below the objective standards of reasonable
representation by competent counsel, and (2) counsel's actions
resulted in prejudice. (<EM>Strickland v. Washington</EM> (1984)
466 U.S. 668, 688, 694 (<EM>Strickland</EM>); <EM>In re Marquez</EM>
(1992) 1 Cal.4th 584, 603.) There is a "`"`"strong presumption that
counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable
professional assistance."'"'" (<EM>People v. Coffman and Marlow</EM>
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 86.) Consequently, an appellant must meet
a strong burden to prevail on this claim. (<EM>Ibid.</EM>)

<P20>When a defendant raises a claim of ineffective assistance
of counsel on direct appeal, the reviewing court will reverse
a conviction only if the record affirmatively discloses counsel
had "`"`no rational tactical purpose'"' for an action or omission."
(<EM>Mickel, supra,</EM> 2 Cal.5th at p. 198; <EM>People v. Mai</EM>
(2013) 57 Cal.4th 986, 1009 [reversal is warranted only on an
affirmative showing that counsel lacked any "rational tactical
purpose for the challenged act or omission, . . . was asked for
a reason but failed to provide one, or there simply could
be no satisfactory explanation"].) "`Unless a defendant establishes
the contrary, we shall presume that "counsel's performance
fell within the wide range of professional competence and
that counsel's actions and inactions can be explained as a
matter of sound trial strategy."'" (<EM>People v. Lopez</EM>
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 960, 966.)

<P20>With regard to prejudice, a "defendant must show that there
is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional
errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.
A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine
confidence in the outcome." (<EM>Strickland, supra,</EM> 466
U.S. at p. 694.) A showing of prejudice requires that defendant
show a "`"demonstrable reality," not simply speculation.'"
(<EM>People v. Fairbank</EM> (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1223, 1241.) Defendant
has not shown that his trial counsel lacked legitimate reasons
to support his tactical decisions or that he suffered undue
prejudice as a result.

<P20>First, making promises about defense evidence in an opening
statement and then failing to deliver that evidence does not
constitute ineffective assistance per se. (<EM>People v. Burnett</EM>
(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 868, 885.) Whether the failure to produce
a promised witness or evidence is tantamount to ineffective
assistance of counsel is a fact-based determination to be
assessed on a case-by-case basis. (<EM>Stanley, supra,</EM>
39 Cal.4th at p. 955.) Forgoing the presentation of promised
testimony or evidence may be a reasonable tactical decision,
depending on the circumstances of the case. (<EM>Ibid.</EM>)

<P20>The record demonstrates that defendant's trial counsel made
reasonable tactical decisions in choosing not to present evidence
about which defendant complains. During defendant's case-in-chief,
the trial court repeatedly warned the parties they were losing
the jury due to their presentation of evidence that was not
relevant to issues before the jury. The court acknowledged
that "bits and pieces" of the evidence presented were relevant,
but that much of it "sound[ed] just like an attack on the integrity
of [witnesses]." Although counsel was entitled to attack witness
credibility, the court found that, at some point, counsel's
repeated attacks "bec[a]me so remote and . . . attenuated . . . counsel
[was] los[ing his] audience." Heeding this warning, defendant's
counsel tailored his questioning about E.C.'s drug use and
poor parenting, defendant's own drug use, his obtaining custody,
and E.C.'s and Renee's lies about defendant and his criminal
activities. Counsel did elicit evidence that E.C.'s addiction
caused her to lose custody. Further evidence of her drug abuse
would only make defendant look like a worse parent, in light
of the fact that that he continued to live with E.C. and the
children while E.C. continued to use drugs. In addition, defense
counsel elicited strong evidence of lies told by both E.C.
and Renee. Neither witness was cooperative, both lacked credibility
and were discredited by defense counsel, and neither woman
was likely to provide testimony helpful to defendant on such
tangential subjects as the cause of his father's death, Matthew
being cut by glass or E.C. doing drugs with Melissa. As Conley
explained in connection with defendant's motion for new trial,
witnesses like E.C. and Renee were "almost ridiculous," and
"bound and determined to deny every way they could." Nevertheless,
defense trial counsel believed he had shown the jury that
the two women were liars and, most importantly, understood
that his client's "case rose and fell with Melissa."

<P20>As for defense counsel's failure to produce the Arizona detective
who interviewed Melissa, Conley explained that he did not
think it would have been helpful because such investigators
were "extremely skilled at fending off counsel's questions
and [defendant might] come out far worse." Nothing the prosecution
had presented led defense counsel to believe otherwise. In
sum, defendant's trial counsel had a reasonable tactical purpose
underlying his decision not to present or continue to pursue
certain evidence. Defendant has not satisfied his substantial
burden to show his trial counsel's performance was deficient.

<P20>Further, defendant has not shown he suffered undue prejudice
as a result of counsel's tactical decisions. As detailed above,
the evidence against defendant was overwhelming and the jury
credited this evidence in the face of E.C.'s and Renee's questionable
credibility and motivation. Defendant has made no showing
that putting on cumulative or tangentially relevant evidence
would have altered the result. Moreover, the jury was properly
instructed that counsel's opening statements and closing arguments
are not evidence, and is "presumed to understand and follow
the court's instructions." (<EM>People v. Holt</EM> (1997) 15
Cal.4th 619, 662.) Defendant failed to satisfy the test to
show ineffective assistance of counsel.

<HN02><EMB>IV. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion
in Denying Defendant's Motion for a New Trial</EMB>

<P20>Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in
denying his motion for new trial (motion). Specifically, Defendant
again makes the argument the court erred in finding him mentally
competent, and also that he received ineffective assistance
of counsel.<fnr8> We have already concluded
the trial court did not err in finding defendant competent,
and we also reject the claim of ineffective assistance.

<HN24><EMB>A. The Relevant Trial Court Proceedings</EMB>

<P20>During the hearing on the motion, Conley was called as a witness
by defendant's current counsel. An issue was raised as to
why Conley failed to elicit more extensive testimony regarding
where and with whom defendant was living at various points
of time. Conley explained that he did not elicit precise dates
from defendant's prior roommates because he had learned before
trial that neither man knew the answer. Rather, they knew
only that "there was a certain period where they interacted
with [defendant]." Conley believed it was much more important
to focus on where defendant was living during the period surrounding
the allegations of molestation of Melissa, and what his apartment
looked like. To that end, Conley elicited one roommate's testimony
that Melissa's bedroom was not consistent with her recollection
of a pink "princess" room.<fnr9> Conley also
had not delved into ownership of a residence on 18th Street
in which defendant had lived because only the fact that defendant
lived there was relevant to the defense, not who owned the
property. Accordingly, Conley focused on witnesses "who knew
where [defendant] was living."

<P20>Conley also testified that he did not obtain records regarding
defendant's incarceration because he saw no advantage for
the defense to show that the reason defendant was not with
Melissa during certain periods of time was because he was
incarcerated. Instead, Conley focused on presenting witnesses
who could testify that there were periods during which defendant
did not see his children. Also, the facts that Melissa had
moved a lot and there were long periods during which she was
absent from school, as well as that Melissa's mother was an
uncooperative and problematic witness, made "it very difficult
to nail down what time periods were real important." Conley's
primary concern was with the allegations of rape between 2001
and 2004 because, "if those . . . were not . . . defeated nothing else . . . really
matter[ed]." Conley also explained that he had weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of presenting evidence regarding
allegations against defendant that the District Attorney declined
to prosecute. Conley concluded that it would not advance the
defense for the jury to hear evidence "that there had been
more and more allegations from the very time almost that Melissa
was born."

<P20>Conley described his efforts to elicit inconsistencies in
Melissa's testimony, but acknowledged that in a case of this
sort, some inconsistencies were "not that unusual." As noted
above, Conley did not believe it would be useful to call the
detective in Arizona who interviewed Melissa to testify because
such investigators were "extremely skilled at fending off counsel's
questions," and that might cause more damage to defendant's
case. Conley also decided against calling witnesses regarding
Matthew's alleged kidnapping because the witnesses he did
call showed the allegations made by E.C. and her mother were
dishonest. Conley chose not to call Anabell as a witness for
several reasons: (1) when Conley's investigator attempted to
meet with Anabell, her stepfather threatened to beat him up;
(2) there was difficulty with subpoena issues because the child
lived in Arizona; and (3) Anabell's testimony would "not . . . do
[defendant] any favors" as her mother had ended her relationship
with defendant "in hatred" of him and the most she could add
to the defense case, if they could get her to testify despite
the above problems, is that she could not say that he had
ever mistreated her.

<P20>Conley was also questioned about why he did not call Dr. Raymond
Anderson as a witness. Anderson had evaluated defendant to
assess whether he was a pedophile. Conley explained he had
had extensive experience with witnesses like Anderson when
he had been an Attorney General in Tennessee. In Conley's
experience, jurors were unlikely to credit the types of tests
administered and conclusions drawn by witnesses like Anderson.
As importantly, Conley's conversation with Dr. Anderson caused
Conley "a great deal of concern . . . ." Anderson had confirmed "aggressive,
over-controlling people [were] more prone to molest," a conclusion
supported by "the literature." Because Conley believed defendant
was "one of the most over-controlling people [he had] encountered,"
he concluded calling Dr. Anderson to testify might backfire.
In addition, it was Conley's opinion that the prosecution's
theory regarding defendant was focused on "patriarchal rape
rather than [defendant being] a pedophile."

<P20>Conley also explained his perception of Yolanda as a witness.
Not only had she failed to "cooperate with [the defense] investigation
at all," Melissa characterized her mother as an enabler more
concerned with her own sex life than her daughter's wellbeing.
As such, Conley concluded "there would have been a lot of damage
in calling Yolanda to the stand . . . ." Moreover, there was enough
evidence Yolanda returned periodically to California after
moving away, that she could not credibly have testified she
and Melissa were not in the state during the time of the molestations.
As for evidence that E.C. made false police reports in order
to retaliate against defendant, Conley believed that, having
heard from Melissa, the jury was unlikely to care about the
fact that E.C. had problems and was not truthful.

<P20>As discussed above, Conley acknowledged he never had defendant
evaluated regarding his mental competency before or during
trial. He explained that was because he never saw any behavior
to lead him to believe defendant might be incompetent. To
the contrary, Conley was very impressed with defendant's intelligence,
and said, in contrast with most clients, even "on a bad day
[defendant understood] much more about what was going on in
the courtroom and much more about what [his counsel] was doing . . . ."
Conley was asked whether defendant ever mentioned his medicines
during trial. Conley recalled that he had had clients who
got "back to jail too late and they [did not] get their medications
on time or . . . miss[ed] a dose." However, he believed, although
defendant had experienced "difficulty with the emotion of all
of his situations, [Conley] didn't feel like it affected [defendant's]
competency." Conley knew defendant had mental health problems
but felt defendant "overstate[d] the . . . problems with respect
to how it affect[ed] his functioning." In Conley's opinion,
defendant consistently "function[ed] on a very high level,
as high as any client that [he had] ever represented." It was
only after defendant's conviction and the fact that his mother
had died or was about to, that Conley "believed [defendant]
was having a melt-down," at which point he requested that
defendant be evaluated. As for defendant's claims regarding
G5's and aliens, Conley "was very dubious of those type of
statements . . . . The likes of which [defendant] had never made to
[Conley] before" and did not raise until after trial.

<P20>When asked why he had not questioned social worker Cotton
more extensively about defendant having hit S.S. with a belt,
Conley explained his belief that the jury could have concluded
from the evidence that E.C. and Renee may "have encouraged
the embellishment of [S.S.'s]" account. Moreover, Conley explained
that the case did not revolve around acts of corporal punishment.
Rather, they "were [in trial] to address the sexual misconduct . . . ."

<P20>When questioned by the prosecution, Conley clarified that
exhibits were admitted to show where defendant lived at various
times, and that argument related to that issue had been made
in closing. Conley confirmed again that defendant had no problems
assisting him in the defense. Defendant had drawn a useful
diagram for Conley during trial and contributed pertinent
questions and areas of examination for witnesses.

<P20>Conley also explained why he had not called the couples' therapist
who worked with E.C. and defendant. The therapist may have
provided testimony about E.C. possibly "slant[ing] some information
about the fact that she was testing dirty and [defendant] wasn't."
Conley did not think such testimony was particularly relevant
to the issue of S.S.'s alleged lies about the sexual abuse.
Moreover, in Conley's opinion, E.C.'s financially motivated
game-playing with DCFS, bore little relevance to the issues
at trial.

<P20>The prosecution also questioned Conley regarding his trial
preparation. Conley explained he had reviewed the discovery
and conducted the investigations he needed to conduct based
on his trial strategy and had also followed up on relevant
suggestions that defendant gave him.

<P20>Upon redirect, Conley acknowledged he had not withheld from
the prosecution a photo that showed that eight-year-old Melissa
attended a family Thanksgiving. Conley explained that he had
turned over other photos, and did not believe it "would have
been ethical to try to put on those photographs [in which Melissa
was absent] and that testimony without acknowledging that
there was one time [when] she [was present]."

<P20>Defense counsel inquired about Conley having potentially confused
the jury. Conley explained that some witnesses, namely E.C.
and Renee, "were . . . almost ridiculous," and were "bound and determined
to deny every way they could." Nevertheless, Conley believed
he had shown the women to be liars and, in any event, he believed
"the case rose and fell with Melissa." He acknowledged one
"never [could] predict what a victim of sexual assault [would]
say. But that's difficult to prepare for."

<P20>At the conclusion of the hearing, defendant's new counsel 
argued that Conley had been ineffective at trial. He pointed
to the trial court's statement during E.C.'s testimony that
Conley was confusing the jury. However, the court explained
that it made that comment in "an attempt to prevent the badgering
of a witness . . . in a very delicate situation," adding that "the
overall trial . . . was very difficult for everybody."

<P20>The court denied the motion for new trial. Based on Conley's
testimony, the court found that defendant was "lawfully present
during the trial." The court also pointed out that defendant's
jail calls showed he was competent, and the record supported
a finding that defendant was malingering. The court found
that Conley and defendant had sufficient notice of the Evidence
Code section 1108 evidence, and that its own section 352 analysis
preceding the admission of such evidence had been correct.
The court concluded that Angelica was a victim and, therefore,
her statement was admissible under section 1360. With regard
to a remark the prosecution made during his opening statement
about defendant having molested his child on Father's Day,
the court said "it was a statement of fact . . . a brief mention . . . there
[was] nothing that [was] inappropriate." The court also
found the statement had not been prejudicial.

<P20>The court acknowledged that DCFS's investigative materials
should have been provided earlier to defense counsel. But
defendant was not prejudiced by the delayed discovery because
his counsel had been allotted additional time to deal with
defense witnesses mentioned in the report.

<P20>As for defendant's revived contention that he received ineffective
assistance of counsel, the court first addressed the claim
that Conley should have called an expert to testify that defendant
lacked the proclivity to molest children, observing that "that
would be problematic . . . ." The court explained Evidence Code section
1108 evidence "really tends to get in the way of that, and . . . the
cross-examination door opening can be huge." Having been
a criminal defense attorney before taking the bench, the judge
said he "would find it very troubling to call such a witness . . . ."
As for defendant's contention that Conley should have objected
when "one of the victims . . . . testified, he raped me," the court
agreed the statement was a legal conclusion. However, it found
defense counsel made a tactical decision not to object. In
any event, the statement "certainly wasn't prejudicial. It
had no impact . . . ."

<P20>In conclusion, the court found Conley "made good and valid
tactical decisions . . ., but even if there was a finding that he
didn't, . . . there was no evidence that the result would [have been]
any different . . . ." The motion was denied.

<HN24><EMB>B. Controlling Law and the Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for a new trial
under the abuse of discretion standard and will not disturb
the trial court's discretionary ruling absent a showing of
"`"a manifest and unmistakable abuse of that discretion."'"
(<EM>People v. Thompson</EM> (2010) 49 Cal.4th 79, 140.)

<P20>Defendant's motion largely reprised arguments that he was
not competent to stand trial or to participate in sentencing
proceedings, and he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
We have addressed these arguments at length and rejected them.
Defendant has made no additional showing to require that we
revisit our conclusions.<fnr10>

<P20>As for defendant's claim that he received ineffective assistance
of counsel, Conley testified at length at the hearing on the
motion. He explained and defended the reasons he had chosen
not to pursue certain avenues of inquiry. He also explained
why he chose not to call certain witnesses or to extend his
examination of witnesses who did testify but lacked credibility.
After hearing his testimony, the trial court found Conley's
explanations credible and concluded that he "made good and
valid tactical decisions" at trial. On appeal, we defer to
the trial court's credibility determinations regarding counsel's
explanations. (<EM>In re Alcox</EM> (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 657,
665.)

<P20>Defendant's final contention is that, at a minimum, his "newly
retained counsel should have been allowed to present [the motion]."
Defendant provides no argument in support of this contention.
Nor does he explain why private counsel was not retained for
several years after trial, after a lengthy string of repeated
attempts to delay the proceedings, and after the court concluded
that DeBlanc, his third appointed attorney who had "conducted . . . substantial
investigation" regarding the motion, would not
or could not have made any additional contributions. The trial
court conducted an appropriate analysis. Defendant has not
shown that the court abused its discretion when it denied
the motion.

<HN02><EMB>V. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion
in Rejecting Defendant's Request To Be Represented by
Newly Retained Counsel</EMB>

<P20>Defendant insists this matter must be remanded for a motion
for new trial because the trial court erred in denying his
request to represented by newly retained private counsel.
Defendant correctly observes that the Sixth Amendment protects
a criminal defendant's right to retained counsel of choice.
(See <EM>People v. O'Malley</EM> (2016) 62 Cal.4th 944, 1004
(<EM>O'Malley</EM>).) Accordingly, federal and state law have long
held that a criminal defendant's right to counsel is "among
the most sacred and sensitive of our constitutional rights"
(<EM>People v. Ortiz</EM> (1990) 51 Cal.3d 975, 982), and the accused
generally has the right to "be defended by the counsel he believes
to be best." (<EM>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez</EM> (2006)
548 U.S. 140, 146 (<EM>Gonzalez-Lopez</EM>).)

<P20>However, as defendant properly concedes, this right is not
absolute. (See <EM>O'Malley, supra,</EM> 62 Cal.4th at p. 1004.)
A trial court has wide latitude in balancing a defendant's
right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and
the demands of its calendar. (<EM>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra,</EM>
548 U.S. at p. 152.) The court may deny a request for substitution
of counsel if that request is untimely and disrupts the orderly
process of justice. (<EM>O'Malley,</EM> at p. 1004.) A defendant's
right to counsel does not permit him "to abuse the patience
of the court through dilatory efforts to seek counsel."
(<EM>People v. Crovedi</EM> (1966) 65 Cal.2d 199, 208.) In determining
whether to grant or deny a request to substitute counsel,
the court considers the totality of the circumstances. (See
<EM>People v. Maciel</EM> (2013) 57 Cal.4th 482, 513.) We review
the trial court's ruling for abuse of discretion. (<EM>People
v. Dowdell</EM> (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1411.)

<P20>By late August 2023 when defendant requested private counsel,
Andrew Flier, be permitted to represent him, more than seven
years had elapsed since the jury rendered its verdict. Defendant
was then being represented by his third appointed attorney,
DeBlanc, whom the court appointed in November 2021. When Flier
appeared and stated his intention to represent defendant,
he informed the court that, not only would he need additional
time to prepare, he was also "substituting in on a really big
press case . . . ."

<P20>The prosecution objected to the substitution of counsel, arguing
that it was nothing more than a last-ditch effort in defendant's
lengthy series of dilatory tactics. The prosecutor said, he
had "been here for seven years, [and] every time [defendant]
gets to this point where it's about to be a sentencing or
a decision[, defendant made] <EM>Marsden[]</EM> [motions] or
refuse[d] to come to court or [said] he [had] mental health
issues." The prosecutor also observed that the "original motion
for new trial [had been] litigated two years ago to the day."
The trial court agreed. It found defendant had long tried
"to subvert the process," and had gone "from counsel to counsel,"
and only retained Flier "a very short period time . . . after Mr.
DeBlanc had conducted . . . substantial investigation [and] substantial
work . . . ." Accordingly, the court denied the request to substitute
counsel.

<P20>Defendant's request to substitute private counsel
was simply the last in a lengthy line of delay tactics. Defendant's
seven <EM>Marsden</EM> requests delayed the proceedings repeatedly,
and he then asserted a disingenuous argument that he lacked
mental competence in a further effort to grind proceedings
to a halt. Finally, after nothing else was left, defendant
made a last-ditch effort to further delay the proceedings
by bringing in newly retained, totally unprepared and apparently
overextended private counsel. In so doing, defendant made
no effort to explain why DeBlanc was unable to competently
handle the matter. The trial court acted well within its rights
to put an end to defendant's manipulative, dilatory tactics.
The "`"right to counsel cannot mean that a defendant may continually
delay his day of judgment by discharging prior counsel, and
the court is within its discretion to deny a last-minute motion . . . to
secure new counsel."'" (<EM>People v. Keshishian</EM> (2008)
162 Cal.App.4th 425, 429.) Defendant's request was "unjustifiably
dilatory" (<EM>People v. Blake</EM> (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 619,
623-624), and the court properly weighed his right to counsel
of choice "`against other values of substantial importance,
[i.e.,] seeking to ensure orderly and expeditious judicial
administration'" (<EM>People v. Courts</EM> (1985) 37 Cal.3d
784, 790). In the absence of any demonstration of good cause,
the trial court acted well within its discretion to prevent
defendant from purposefully continuing to disrupt the orderly
processes of justice and impair efficient judicial administration.

<CN><EMB>DISPOSITION</EMB>

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>LUI, P. J. and ASHMANN-GERST, J., concurs.
<FN>
<fnt*> This case involves material from a sealed record related to
hearings under <EM>People v. Marsden</EM> (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118.
In accordance with California Rules of Court, rules 8.45,
8.46(g)(1) and (2), we have prepared both public (redacted)
and sealed (unredacted) versions of this opinion. We order
the unredacted version of this opinion sealed.

<fnt1> Because some witnesses share the same
surname and to protect the parties' privacy we identify several
by first name or initials; we intend no disrespect. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.90(b).)

<fnt2> The record shows a variation of her name
as "Anabelle."

<fnt3> Two counts were dismissed at the prosecution's
request: Count 6 (lewd act upon Roxanne between July 25, 2006,
and July 25, 2008; Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a)); and count
7 (cruelty to a child by inflicting injury on Matthew between
Feb. 1, 2014, and Feb. 28, 2014; &sect; 273a, subd. (b)).

<fnt4> That issue was later addressed and rejected
by the court in the hearing on defendant's new trial motion
after which the court found that defendant's "objection under
the confrontation clause [could not] survive[]" because the
prosecution satisfied the requirements of Evidence Code section
1360, and Angelica was a victim. Defendant does not challenge
that finding on appeal and his reply brief does not respond
to the People's argument on this point.

<fnt6> The People argue that defendant's argument
regarding competency has been forfeited because, on appeal,
he fails to present anything other than conclusory allegations
and undeveloped argument, and states only that his "incompetence
and issues regarding his medications were manifested throughout
the proceedings and a doubt should have been declared early . . . ."
(See <EM>People v. Roberto V.</EM> (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1350,
1364, fn. 6 [providing only "[a] brief, conclusory allegation"
with no "substantial argument or citation to authority" to
support a defendant's contention "constitutes a waiver of the
point on appeal"]; <EM>Multani v. Witkin & Neal</EM> (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 1428, 1457 ["`Mere suggestions of error without supporting
argument or authority . . . do not properly present grounds for
appellate review.'"]; <EM>In re S.C.</EM> (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th
396, 408 [When a point is asserted without argument and authority
for the proposition, "`it is deemed to be without foundation
and requires no discussion by the reviewing court'"].) We
conclude that defendant's appellate arguments are minimally
sufficient and reject the assertion of forfeiture.

<fnt7> Specifically, defendant argues that his
trial counsel failed to present the following evidence: (1)
Evidence of an incident involving E.C.'s use of methamphetamine
and Matthew being injured on some glass she broke; (2) defendant's
addiction to methamphetamine; (3) the fact that defendant's
father died of a drug overdose; (4) defendant's receipt of
welfare benefits and sole custody of his children; (5) a counselor's
warning to defendant that he needed to get the children away
from E.C. because of her drug use; (6) Renee's threat to have
defendant sent to prison and to have him killed; (7) the fact
that he saw E.C. and Melissa use drugs together; and (8) the
failure to present testimony by an Arizona detective who specialized
in sexual abuse cases who interviewed Melissa, whose story
was problematic and had dramatically grown by the time of
the interview.

<fnt8> Defendant's motion raised the following
contentions of error: (1) He was not lawfully present during
trial within the meaning Penal Code section 1181.1; (2) the
prosecution did not satisfy the notice requirement of Evidence
Code section 1108, subdivision (b); (3) the court erred in admitted
Angelica's testimony; (4) the prosecution committed prejudicial
misconduct during its opening statement; (5) the prosecution
failed timely to provide defendant with discovery to permit
him to prepare for the cross-examination of witnesses who
participated in DCFS investigations and proceedings; (6) his
right to counsel was violated; and (7) his right to due process
was violated.

<fnt9> Conley also explained that, although he
had an investigator speak with another potential witness (Perla
C.), he had not called her to testify about where defendant
lived during a certain time period because defendant's other
roommates had adequately covered the same time frame.

<fnt10> Indeed, defendant's appellate briefs
make no argument at all specific to the motion regarding his
competence. Rather, he merely incorporates his earlier argument
on that issue. We rejected this argument on its merits. Moreover,
defendant's failure to support or develop his conclusory arguments
as they relate to his assertion that the motion was wrongly
denied constitutes forfeiture of such assertions on appeal.
</FN>
